Hello world! The first necessary post in a tech blog!
My name is Konstantinos, I'm an SRE and open source enthusiast. My pursuit is to get a better understanding of Linux, networking, build a cool homelab and last but not least document everything and help anyone i can along the way!  


Hope to see you around!
