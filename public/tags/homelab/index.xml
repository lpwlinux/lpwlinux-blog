      <description>The goal of this post is to set up the (in my opinion) essence of the homelab, the remote access. Who does not want to have access to all the awesome stuff you set up in the first place?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over my approach focusing on being to the point and keeping the cost to a minimum. Since we are talking about a homelab I&amp;rsquo;ll assume there is a container manager in place, proxmox in my case does the job(in general even a desktop or an old laptop will do in order to run tailscale.</description>
